All orders within a batch are settled at the same uniform clearing price. While batch auctions typically operate on a single token pair, multi-dimensional batch auctions allow for orders between multiple token pairs to be settled in the same batch. This is particularly useful for fragmented token spaces, such as USD-stablecoins, or less liquid token pairs, like certain insurance or prediction market outcome tokens. Trades can happen between direct counterparties or in ring formations. Batch auctions offer several benefits: 1. Best Price Discovery: They set the price exactly where supply and demand meet, ensuring a fair price for all participants. 2. Fair and Resistant: They avoid gas wars and other forms of manipulation, with willingness to pay determining final prices and timed batches protecting users from frontrunning. 3. Easy to Use: Bidders can participate by simply determining two parameters (amount and price), while auctioneers can start an auction using the Gnosis Safe App or by running a simple script."

Oracles solve this problem by acting as intermediaries, feeding verified data to smart contracts, which is essential for various use cases like financial services, supply chain management, and prediction markets. Oracles can be classified into several types, including software oracles (accessing online data sources), hardware oracles (interacting with physical devices), and human oracles (relying on human input). They can also be centralized or decentralized, with the latter offering higher levels of trust and security."

Whoever stakes the most tokens ranks highest, but the more tokens you stake, the cheaper it is to downvote you. Votes cost tokens, which makes the system sybil resistant. Upvotes stake more tokens in the contract. The cost to downvote is sent directly back to the person being voted on. This allows for an intuitive and simple interface, similar to Reddit, with a transparent economic algorithm that provably benefits the community who uses it."

Token emissions are continuously modified based on the percentage of the circulating supply. As more tokens are locked in ve, emissions have a reduced impact. For instance, if 50% of tokens are ve locked, the emission rate would halve. 2. ve lockers' holdings increase proportionally to emissions, preventing dilution. If there is a 5% supply increase due to emissions, ve lockers' holdings are also increased by 5%. 3. ve locks are represented as NFTs, enabling one address to hold multiple locks and trade them on secondary markets. This resolves the capital inefficiency and liquidity concerns associated with ve assets. This is designed to encourage users to lock their tokens, resulting in a more stable environment."
